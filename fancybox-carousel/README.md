# JQuery Carousel Project
This project is a simple HTML page with four sections, each containing an image and a corresponding paragraph of text. When you click on any of the images, it opens a carousel with navigation buttons that allow you to browse through the images in a slideshow format.
## Features

- **Image Sections**: The HTML page is divided into four sections, each with an image and a paragraph of text.

- **Carousel**: Clicking on any image opens a carousel, providing a full-screen view of the images.

- **Navigation**: The carousel includes right and left buttons that allow you to navigate between images. Clicking the "X" button closes the carousel.
